		Initiate the required elevators and floors
		Now, we need to pass a set of commands to the elevator system from a file to operate the elevators.
		we need to call the elevator, choose a floor, and step through the system to see how the elevators move.
		We also need to be able to see the status of the elevators at any point in time.
		We also need to be able to initiate an emergency protocol.
		We can do this by reading a file and passing the commands to the elevator system.
		We can use a simple text file with one command per line.

		 1. CALL <floor> <direction>
		 2. SELECT <floor>
		 3. STEP
		 4. STATUS
		 5. EMERGENCY
		 6. EXIT

		We can use a simple parser to read the file and execute the commands.
